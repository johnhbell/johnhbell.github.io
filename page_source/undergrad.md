# Power Grid Stability and Liquid Metal Recapillarity (Undergraduate Research)

## Power Grid Stability

*Key Skills: Stochastic Modeling*

In this work, I leveraged the Fokker-Planck equation to characterize the
stochastic frequency properties of power grids whose frequencies are
controlled by governors possessing a deadband.

to frequency changes

## Liquid Metal Recapillarity

*Key Skills: Experimental Design, Image Analysis*

In this work, I iterated on the idea of using an electrical potential to
reduce the oxide layer of a liquid metal alloy, eutectic Gallium-Indium
(EGaIn). Using this process, I developed methods to form the liquid
metal on sheets, as well as a method for creating a uniform sheet of the
liquid metal using a glass test-tube-based applicator which I designed.

While doing this, I discovered that the retreat velocity of a liquid
metal interface during the reduction process is proportional to the
current density at that interface, which I characterized using a set of
experiments utilizing automated video analysis to measure retreat
velocity and estimate current density.

*Key Skills: Mechanical Design, Design for Manufacturing, FEA, Sensor
Electronic Design*

I worked with a team of graduate students to design and manufacture a
lathe with an instrumented tool holder capable of measuring cutting
forces. My key role in the team was the FEA modeling and manufacturing
of flexures in the lathe, as well as the design of the electronics for
the force measurement of the tool holder.
